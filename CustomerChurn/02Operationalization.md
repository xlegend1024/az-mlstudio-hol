# 04. Operationalization with AML Studio

## Architecture

When you conduct multple experiments, you will find the most appropreate model for your buiness. And after the model selection, you need to make the score model as a service to use for your business. In this lab, we'll create a web service to expose your score model.

* Deploy a Web Service

## 0. Access to AZ ML Studio

Open a new browser or tap and go to [Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net)

## 1. Select Model

Based on the result, __click__ on a model you want to use for operation, and then __click__ _'Predictive Web Service [Recommended]'_ to be ready to operationalize your model

When Predictive Experiment is ready, click on 'Run' to make model ready

When running is done your screen will look like following

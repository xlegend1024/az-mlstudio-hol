# II. Train Model

## Create Energy Effiency Prediction Model (2/4)

This is sceond step of four steps.

1. Understand Data

1. Train Model

1. Evaluate Score

1. Deploy Mode 

***

## 5. Select columns

__Search__ 'Select Columns in Dataset' and __drop__ the module on canvas. __Select__ on the module and __click__ 'Lanuch column selector'.

Since we're going to predict 'Cooling Load' for this lab, remove 'Heating Load' column from our dataset. To do that __click__ 'WITH RULES' and __select__ 'ALL COLUMNS' and __select__ 'EXCLUDE', 'COLUMN NAMES'. And then __click__ 'Heating Load'. __Click__ okay, close the popup window.

## 6. Split data

Before we train a model, we need to split datasets into two group. One for training and one for scoreing. __Search__ 'Split Data' module and drop it on canvas. Make a connection between 'Select Columns in Dataset' and 'Split Data' module. 

To set properties of the 'Split Data' module,  __select__ the module and change fraction of row to 0.75 and randdom seed with any number.

## 7. Select Algorithm

Before choose train model algorithm, put 'Train Model' moudle on canvas. Make a connection between left port of 'Split Data' and right port of 'Train Model' module.

__Click__ the 'Train Model' and __select__ 'Cooling Load' which is our label. And __click__ okay botton to close window.

There're manay regression algorithm. In this lab 'Linear Regression' will be used. Search the 'Linear Regression' module and drop it on the canvas. Make a connection between 'Linear Regression' and 'Train Model'.

To review how model works, use 'Score Model'. Searh it and drop the module on canvas. Make a connection between output port of 'Trian Model' and left port of 'Score Model'. Also make a connection between right port of 'Split Data' and right port of 'Score Model'.

## 8. Run Experiment

__Click__ run to execute experiment. It'll take 30 seconds.

## 9. Review Experiment Result

To see score model results, __right click__ on 'Score Model' and __select__ 'Visualize' on submenu. You can see predicted values and real values. From the result you can have rough guess how model perform.

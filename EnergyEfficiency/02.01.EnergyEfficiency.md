# Understand Data

## Create Energy Effiency Prediction Model

This is first step of four steps.

1. Understand Data

1. Train Model

1. Evaluate Score

1. Deploy Mode 

***

### Azure Machine Learning Studio 

If you're not log on Azure Machine Learning Studio, go to <a href="https://studio.azureml.net/" target="_blank">Azure Machine Learning Studio</a>.

### 1. Start NEW experiment

Click [+ NEW] and [Blank Experiment].

### 2. Rename experiment
You'll see canvas in Azure Machine Learning Studio. Before we do some experiment, update name of the experiment. Click on tile and chage it to 'Energy Prediction'.

### 3. Load data

There are many ways you can load data you studio. Here you're going to use sample data that is loaded in Studio. To get the data, search 'Energy' on left search box. And then  drag and drop the 'Energy Efficiency Regression data' to canvas.

## Upload dataset

Before you start new experiment, you can upload sample dataset from your local pc to Azure Machine Learning Studio. To start the task, click [+ NEW] icon on the screen.

![NewExperiment](../images/03.png)

Click on [From Local File].

![Uploaddataset](../images/04.png)

You can browse a file and upload it in the Upload a new dataset window. You can upload a file at a time but, you can upload multiple files at the same time by reapting this task.

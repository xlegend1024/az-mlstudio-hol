# III. Evaluate Model

## Create Energy Effiency Prediction Model (3/4)

This is third step of four steps.

1. Understand Data

1. Train Model

1. Evaluate Score

1. Deploy Mode 

***

## 10. Use Evaluation 

To have better understanding how model works you need to use 'Evaluate Model' module. __Search__ 'Evaluate Model' and drop it on canvas. Make a link between 'Score Model' and 'Evaluate Model' modules.

Run experiment and see result. To see the result, right __click__ on the 'Evaluate Model' and __select__ 'Visualize'. There're many metrics that show how your model works. One of the popual metric that shows regression model performance is 'Coefficient of Determination'.

## 11. Compare with another algorithm

Not sure 'Linear Regression' is best model for our prediction. So let's try another model to build prediction model. 

__Select__ 'Train Model' and 'Score Model'. And __Copy__(Ctrl+C) and __paste__(Ctrl+V) which will help you to create 'Train Model' and 'Score Model' modules on your canvas.

Search 'Bossted Decision Tree Regression'. Run experiment.

See the result and choose better result for your preditcion.
